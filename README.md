In this project, uses the image processing library (bmplib) that is used to process a color image, identify objects (aka “components”), and then allow the user to move the objects in the image and reorder the layers to move them “forward” and "backward".

This project contains usages of vectors, deques, more dynamic allocation, and implementing the BFS algorithm.
